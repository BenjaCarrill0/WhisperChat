# WhisperChat📨📨
This program is built in python and is a project that uses only the contents of the course IIC2233 (Advance Programming) of Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile.


## Important considerations
In this project first I will try to make WhisperChat without a GUI so the only way to operate is through the command console.

After I fulfill that I would make a GUI for WhisperChat and would be more interactive thanks to PyQt6. You could send images and music. But at this moment the users could only send text.

## Warning ⚠️⚠️
I forgot what I was doing because I left the project for about two weeks. As long as this section exists in the README I will keep WhisperChat on hold.
